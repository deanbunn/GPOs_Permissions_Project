## GPOs Permissions Project

This project solution is based upon two scripts. 

One to report the current permission level granted to a specific AD group on each GPO assigned to OUs in a department OU.

The second script will add permissions for the new admin group by taking the GPO Ids from the report of the first script and configuring the required settings.


### Requirements

The PowerShell Active Directory and Group Policy Modules must be installed on the system.
